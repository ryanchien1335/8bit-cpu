# 8-Bit CPU Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple 8-bit CPU in Logisim, along with a Python assembler. 
The CPU currently supports basic arithmetic, logic operations, memory access, and program control using a small instruction set.
Additionals features will be added in the future to allow for more complex operations.

## Instruction Format
Each instruction is 8 bits:

```text

[ OPCODE (4 bits) ] [OPERAND (4 bits)]
